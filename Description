Welcome to the peeMarksmanship wiki!

Project description:

Bullseye for toilets that measures one's aim while peeing. 
It's intended for public restrooms (think bar, pub). 
The user would try to aim for the center of the bullseye (that would be in the toilet) while taking a leek. 
Once the user flushes the toilet the score is printed out.

The bullseye has three different levels, each one related to a different score (5,10,20). 
The circles are not concentric. At the bottom of each level there is a sensor that measures the volume of liquid/time. T
he score is based of the amount of liquid that pases though each sensor.

There is a button connected to the chain (button you push to flush the toilet) 
that when you push it prints out your final score on the display and resets the score.
